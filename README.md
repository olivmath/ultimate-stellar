# Ultimate Stellar - People CRUD Contract

This project implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) contract for managing People records on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar Development Environment
- Git

## Installation Requirements

1. Install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Install Stellar CLI:

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

3. Install Wasm Target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

4. Autocompletion

```bash
source <(stellar completion --shell zsh) # bash
echo "source <(stellar completion --shell zsh)" >> ~/.zshrc # bash
```

## Configure keys and Faucet

```bash
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet --fund
```

## Project Structure

5. Create a People Data Base Project

```
stellar contract init --name people-db .
```

6. Your project folders structures

```bash
ultimate-stellar/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
└── contracts
    └── people-db
        ├── Cargo.toml
        ├── Makefile
        └── src
            ├── lib.rs
            └── test.rs

4 directories, 6 files
```

7. Build your Smartcontracts

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Testing the Project

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```
